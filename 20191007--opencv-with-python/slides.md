## About OpenCV

- https://opencv.org/

- fast computer vision library

- programmed in C++

- interfaces to lots of languages, i.e. Python

---

## Python installation

- Documentation is very C++ centric

- easiest installation is imho:

```
pip install opencv-contrib-python-headless
```

(this installs binary libraries too)

## My current opencv project
