## What is FastAPI?

- https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/
- web framework for building APIs
- Python 3.6+
- async first
- type support


---

## FastAPI vs. Flask vs. Django

### async / Python 3.6+

- Flask is not async ready
- Django just started getting async support

### small vs. batteries included

- FastAPI is more like Flask
- Django is more of a full featured web framework and not only for APIs


---

## What is Spacy?

- https://spacy.io/
- Industrial-Strength Natural Language Processing
- great tool if you need language processing (and your language is supported)
- used here to tag parts of speech in a sentence
